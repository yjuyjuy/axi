<h3 align="center">10 design principles for building agent-ergonomic apps.</h3>

AI agents interact with external services through two dominant paradigms today: **CLIs** which were originally built for humans, and structured tool protocols like **MCP**. Both impose significant overhead.

AXI is a **new paradigm** - agent-native CLI tools built from **10 design principles** that treat token budget as a first-class constraint.

## Results

### GitHub Benchmark

Evaluated across 425 runs (17 tasks × 5 conditions × 5 repeats) using Claude Sonnet 4.6:

| Condition               | Success  | Avg Cost   | Avg Duration | Avg Turns |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------- |
| **gh-axi**              | **100%** | **$0.050** | **15.7s**    | **3**     |

| GitHub MCP + ToolSearch | 82%      | $0.147     | 41.1s        | 8         |
| MCP + Code Mode         | 84%      | $0.101     | 43.4s        | 7         |

Claude Sonnet 4.6 is the model the published runs used, not a limit of the
harness. Both benchmarks take `--model`, which is passed straight through to
the agent CLI, so any Claude model works - for example
`--model claude-opus-4-6`. Results for other models are simply not published
here, and they may respond differently to output format.

## Quick Start

Reference AXI implementations:

- [`gh-axi`](https://github.com/kunchenguid/gh-axi) — GitHub operations
- [`chrome-devtools-axi`](https://github.com/kunchenguid/chrome-devtools-axi) — Browser automation

See the full [AXI Catalog](#axi-catalog) below for all official and community AXIs.

```sh
npm install -g gh-axi
npm install -g chrome-devtools-axi
```

Add to your `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`:

```
Use `gh-axi` for GitHub and `chrome-devtools-axi` for browser automation.
```

## The 10 Principles

These principles define what makes a CLI tool "an AXI".
The table below is generated from [`principles.yaml`](principles.yaml); the full specification of each principle lives in the [AXI skill](.agents/skills/axi/SKILL.md).

<!-- generated:principles:start -->

| #   | Principle                          | Summary                                                                                     |
| --- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Token-efficient output**         | Use [TOON](https://toonformat.dev/) format for ~40% token savings over JSON                 |
| 2   | **Minimal default schemas**        | 3–4 fields per list item, not 10+                                                           |
| 3   | **Content truncation**             | Truncate large text with size hints and a `--full` escape hatch                             |
| 4   | **Pre-computed aggregates**        | Include aggregated counts and statuses that eliminate round trips                           |
| 5   | **Definitive empty states**        | Explicit "0 results" rather than ambiguous empty output                                     |
| 6   | **Structured errors & exit codes** | Idempotent mutations, structured errors, no interactive prompts, fail loud on unknown flags |
| 7   | **Ambient context**                | Install opt-in session integrations first, then offer an on-demand skill                    |
| 8   | **Content first**                  | Running with no arguments shows live data, not help text                                    |
| 9   | **Contextual disclosure**          | Include next-step suggestions after each output                                             |
| 10  | **Consistent way to get help**     | Concise per-subcommand reference when agents need it                                        |

Built an AXI? Follow the [contributor workflow](CONTRIBUTING.md) to add it to this list.

## Build Your Own AXI

Install the AXI skill to get the design guidelines and scaffolding for building an AXI-compliant CLI:

```sh
npx skills add kunchenguid/axi
```

This installs the [AXI skill](.agents/skills/axi/SKILL.md) - a detailed guide with examples for each principle that your coding agent can reference while building.
For your own AXI, expose an explicit setup command for session hooks as the primary integration, then ship an installable Agent Skill as a lower-overhead secondary path.
Users only need one path, but hooks and skills complement each other when both are available.

## Development

### Browser Benchmark

The browser benchmark harness lives in `bench-browser/`. It compares browser automation tools across 16 browsing tasks.

```sh
pnpm install

# Run a single condition × task
pnpm --dir bench-browser run bench -- run --condition chrome-devtools-axi --task read_static_page

# Run the full matrix
pnpm --dir bench-browser run bench -- matrix --repeat 5

# Generate summary report
pnpm --dir bench-browser run bench -- report

# Render the social video
pnpm --dir bench-browser run render:social
```

The HyperFrames composition for the social asset lives in `bench-browser/social/`. Edit `social/index.html` for the animation and render `docs/social/rendered/race.mp4` with `pnpm --dir bench-browser run render:social`.

Published results (490 runs): [`bench-browser/published-results/report.md`](bench-browser/published-results/report.md)

### GitHub Benchmark

The GitHub benchmark harness lives in `bench-github/`. It runs agent tasks across different interface conditions and grades results with an LLM judge.

```sh
pnpm install

# Run a single condition × task
pnpm --dir bench-github run bench -- run --condition axi --task merged_pr_ci_audit --repeat 5 --agent claude

# Run the full matrix
pnpm --dir bench-github run bench -- matrix --repeat 5 --agent claude

# Generate summary report
pnpm --dir bench-github run bench -- report
```
